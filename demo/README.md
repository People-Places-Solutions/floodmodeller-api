# Get Started with the Floodmodeller Python API!

Welcome to the Floodmodeller API Demo Codespaces!

You can use this to experiment with the API without needing to install anything on your laptop. 

> Attention! ⏱️ You will need to wait one minute after opening for the Codespace to install our dependencies (this won't take long)...

# Demo Notebooks
There are a few demo notebooks which contain some code you can run. You can also use these notebooks to write your own code! Click the links in the section below to open each notebook editor and get started with the API.

If you're new to python or jupyter notebooks, start here --> 
[Introduction to python](01-get-started.ipynb)

This notebook introduces the main principles of the API  -->

# Using this codespace

This interactive codespace allows you to use the Flood Modeller API without the hassle 
of setting up your own local environment, and is private to your GitHub account. You can
use the codespace for:
- Writing and running scripts that use the API
- Uploading and downloading model files to use in code
- Editing the API code as you need
- Adding new features to the API and opening a pull request

Any changes you make will be saved until the next time you open up this codespace.

There are a few limitations of using this codespace compared with setting up your own python
environment:
- There is a limit of 60 hours per month of usage - unless you set up billing with GitHub
- You won't be able to run models (using `.simulate() methods) as it will not connect to
your Flood Modeller license
