                  Diagnostic File
  

Flood Modeller 1D Solver run parameters modified as follows:
 dflood set to          1.0000m 
 Rules evaluated at time zero = T
 Rules evaluated on first iteration = F
 Rules times reset after positional instruction = T
 Floodplain section area constrained by modular limit = T
 Use flow from culvert outlet remote node = T

 Bridge section properties refined every  2.0% of (max section height +       10.0m )

 Solve dh = 0 at t0 in reservoirs.
