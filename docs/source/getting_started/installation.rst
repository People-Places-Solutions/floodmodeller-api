Installation and Importing
****************************
Before installing the Flood Modeller API, first ensure you already have Python installed on your machine (version 3.6 or greater) and, ideally, have a dedicated python environment set up.
Consider using `miniforge <https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge>`_ as a lightweight, open-source package manager. 

Once you have your Python environment set up, you can install the floodmodeller_api package directly from PyPI using the following command:

.. code:: console

   pip install floodmodeller-api

It is recommended to regularly update directly from PyPI as this will ensure you have latest version:

.. code:: console

   pip install floodmodeller-api --upgrade

To ensure the package has installed successfully, open up a python console and try importing it:

.. code:: python

   import floodmodeller_api
