What's new in 0.4.0 (September 2022)
**************************************

This page details the changes for version 0.4.0 of Flood Modeller Python API

New features
--------------
- 2D model support (XML2D Class): Read and edit Flood Modeller 2D model xml files
- 1D & 2D log file support (LF1 & LF2 Classes): Read and analyse simulation logs and 
  diagnostics

Updates
--------------
- Updated methods for testing equivalence between Flood Modeller class instances. Two 
  instances of the same class can now be tested using ``==`` to check whether they are 
  equivalent. In addition, a detailed breakdown of any differences can be found using 
  the ``.diff()`` method::
    dat_a = DAT('some_network.dat')
    dat_b = DAT('another_similar_network.dat')

    if dat_a == dat_b:  # returns True/False
        print('Files are equivalent')
    else:
        print('Files not equivalent')
    
    dat_a.diff(dat_b)  # prints a list of differences to terminal
- RNWEIR Unit Class added (Broad Crested Weir)


Bug fixes
--------------
- Fix issue that occured in IEF class if any values contained '=' in the value, for 
  example within a flowtimeprofile line.
