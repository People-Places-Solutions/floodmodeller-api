Updates
--------------
- Event Data attributes in IEF files are now treated as a dictionary object as opposed to 
  a list. This allows for each event data to have an associated title which is defined in
  the IEF file as a comment before the event data attribute. The dictionary keys represent
  the titles, and the values represent the event data paths. An example would look like
  this::
    ief = IEF("path/to/file.ief")
    ief.eventdata
    >>> {
            'MainInflow' : 'Q100.IED',
            'TribInflow' : 'Q100_trib.IED',
            'TidalBoundary' : 'T100_DSBDY.IED'
        }
  
  This would then write out the following lines in the IEF file::
    ;MainInflow
    EventData=Q100.IED
    ;TribInflow
    EventData=Q100_trib.IED
    ;TidalBoundary
    EventData=T100_DSBDY.IED

  **Please note, this introduces a change which is incompatible with previous versions of
  the API in how event data in IEF files is handled. Any existing code that treats eventdata
  as a list will need to be updated in order to run this version.**
