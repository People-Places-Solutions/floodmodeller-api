What's new in 0.4.1 (XXXX 202x)
**************************************

This page details the changes for version 0.4.1 of Flood Modeller Python API

New features
--------------
- Add/remove units and reaches from 1D networks
- Add/remove elements from 2D xml models
- Simulate method added to XML2D
- Automatic backups

Updates
--------------
- Event Data attributes in IEF files are now treated as a dictionary object as opposed to 
  a list. This allows for each event data to have an associated title which is defined in
  the IEF file as a comment before the event data attribute. The dictionary keys represent
  the titles, and the values represent the event data paths. An example would look like
  this::

    ief = IEF("path/to/file.ief")
    ief.eventdata = {
        'MainInflow' : 'Q100.IED',
        'TribInflow' : 'Q100_trib.IED',
        'TidalBoundary' : 'T100_DSBDY.IED'
    }

  This would then write out the following lines in the IEF file::

    ;MainInflow
    EventData=Q100.IED
    ;TribInflow
    EventData=Q100_trib.IED
    ;TidalBoundary
    EventData=T100_DSBDY.IED


  .. warning::
    Please note, this introduces a change which is incompatible with previous versions of
    the API in how event data in IEF files is handled. Any existing code that treats eventdata
    as a list will need to be updated in order to run this version. 

- CRUMP Unit Class added
- FLAT_V_WEIR Unit Class added
- INTERPOLATE Unit Class added
- REPLICATE Unit Class added
- OUTFALL Unit Class added
- UNSUPPORTED Unit Class added
- Find and return the next unit in reach with ``.next()`` function::
    dat = DAT('some_network.dat')
    some_unit = dat.sections['some_unit_name']
    dat.next(some_unit)
- Find previous unit in reach with ``.prev()`` function::
    dat = DAT('some_network.dat')
    dat.prev(dat.strucutre['structure_name'])
- Improved test module

Bug fixes
--------------
